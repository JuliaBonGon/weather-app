# My first weather app

With this solo project I created a simple weather app with basic features for the below class exercise.
I did this repository after just 2 months learning to code.

## Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX-like requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an API


## The Mission

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.  
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

### Specifications

One of the more interesting features in JavaScript is to be able to get information from somewhere else.

A typical flow that is used to get outside data, is to make a **request** to a certain location (url).

This location will then compile the data based on the request sent, and send back a **response** to the origin of the request.

This flow is often used when communicating with **RESTfull API's** (REST = when the architecture/url defines what the response should be)
