# My first weather app

With this solo project I created a simple weather app with basic features for the below class exercise.
I was able to do this after just 2 month since I started learning to code. I had 4 days for it.

## Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX-like requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an API
